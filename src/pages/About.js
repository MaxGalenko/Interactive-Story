                <p className="text-center text-pretty">Dive into an immersive interactive horror experience where your choices shape the fate of four friends exploring a cursed cabin deep in Ravenwood Forest. 
                    As whispers from the trees beckon and shadows dance ominously, every decision you make triggers a chain of events—no choice is ever as simple as it seems. 
                    This is a butterfly effect based story, where small actions can lead to vastly different outcomes, and your friends' lives hang in the balance.

                <br></br>
                <p className="text-center text-pretty">Will you uncover the dark secrets hidden within the forest, confront the malevolent spirit, or succumb to the night? 
                    Each decision you face is fraught with peril, and the path ahead is shaped by your choices—will you save your friends, or will the forest claim them all? 
                    The fate of everyone is in your hands.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p className="text-center text-pretty">Every choice matters—choose wisely, for the forest is alive with danger, and the consequences of your actions will echo through the night. 
                    Are you ready to face the darkness?
